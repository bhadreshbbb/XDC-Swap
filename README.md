## 🤷‍♀️ Question Time

### 👨‍🔬 What is XDC-Swap?

XDC-Swap is a DeFi project that consists of a staking app, lending app, and has an entire Decentralized Exchange built on top of the XDC chain [XDC-Fi](https://sc-dex-xdc.vercel.app/)

And if that were'nt enough, it also consists of an entire npm package that allows you to interact with the core contracts to build different types of DeFi contracts and applications ontop of the XDC Chain.

### 🕵️ What is DeFi?

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology that challenges the current centralized banking system. DeFi eliminates the fees that banks and other financial companies charge for using their services and promotes the use of peer-to-peer, or P2P, transactions.

## ☄️ What's next?

XDC-Swap has been an amazing project to learn from and the chain XDC is quiet a fascinating chain with most of it's own tools to work with and as emerging and enthusiastic builders we are all up for the challenge to improve and consistently work on the product. We are also planning on adding more stuff to build on for users to make building in DeFi with XDC a lot more convenient and easier.
